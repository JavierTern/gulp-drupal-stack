Gulp Drupal Stack
=================

![gulp-drupal-stack-banner](banner.png)

This stack core is to be included in your main project and sets up many Gulp tasks that can work in many flexible ways by passing in different `config` objects, which can be based off of `gulpfile.default.yml` (and is merged with).


## Features

- SCSS => CSS compiling with LibSass, PostCSS, linting, and SourceMaps
- JS compiling via Babel, linting and aggregation
- webpack module bundling
- SVG => Font Icons compiling with support for adding mixins and classes to SCSS along with a demo page
- Drupal file watching to trigger Drush cache clears

All is easily configurable by changing values in your `gulpfile.yml` file in your project. These values are merged into the `gulpfile.default.yml` file - look there for the available options and defaults.


## Prerequisites

- [Node](https://nodejs.org)
- [Gulp-cli](http://gulpjs.com/): `npm install -g gulp-cli`
